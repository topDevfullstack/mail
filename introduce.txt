Hello everyone!
I can automate many of your little tasks.

For example, if you like 2048, my program can understand the game situation for you and automatically control the keyboard and mouse to help you get the biggest number possible in the game.
If you like Tetris, my program can control the keyboard for you and help you beat your opponent.

In this way, I like to develop automated programs by combining various functions such as screen capture, image processing, image recognition, optimized algorithms, and keyboard and mouse control using system API.

I am also good at web scraping.

I am also a senior software developer with significant experience in desktop app, web, and firmware development. 
My preferred programming languages are C/C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP.

If you want to order work for me, please contact me at any time.
