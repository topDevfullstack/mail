1:10 AM
If you rent out an account for me, we will get a nice income together.
By using the Freelancer account you verified, I can earn 1000-3000$ in the first month and then I can earn 2000-6000$ per month.

Jackson, 1:10 AM
okay 

ok 

1:10 AM
If you rent out a Freelancer account for me and give me the necessary assistance such as AnyDesk, Payoneer, Telegram, and Linkedin, I will give you 20% of my income.
20% is small?

Jackson, 1:12 AM
yes

Now, I'll teach you about what you have to do.
At first, You have to get a computer and the computer must work 24hours per day.

Jackson, 1:31 AM
ok

1:31 AM
And then, you have to make a account on Freelancer.com and verify using your identity.
As you know, I can't make much money if I sign up for an account of Freelancer or Upwork with my Chinese identity.
you make a account, but making account need my skills and achievements.
because I have to work, not you.
Are you there?
In a word, the account should be created with your identity, but the profile should be created with my skills or achievements. This way, I can receive and perform tasks that are suitable for me.
Do you understand?
Sorry for my poor English skill.

Jackson, 1:40 AM
yes i  got it 

tell me which portal i need to make the account 

1:42 AM
Listen to me a little more.

Jackson, 1:42 AM
okay 

1:42 AM
At first, you have to set up AnyDesk on your computer.

Jackson, 1:43 AM
done 

1:44 AM
By using AnyDesk, I can control your computer as if it were my own.
And then, we have to make an account of Freelancer.com, discussing together.

Jackson, 1:45 AM
ok

1:46 AM
Some values you enter, and some values I enter.

sometimes, I use translator, please understand me.
When you create an account, you will need to link your phone number and Payoneer account number to the account you create.
After Freelancer account made, you have to provide to me Telegram, Linkedin verified using your phone number or identity.
It'll help my work.
Once my work on your account begins, I will pay you 30% of my earnings each month.
But you can't take the money I earn for yourself.
Then our cooperation will end, and we will both suffer losses.
I want you to be a great and capable collaborator. I also want our cooperation to last as long as possible.
what do you think about my suggestion?

Jackson, 2:06 AM

Then our cooperation will end, and we will both suffer losses.

If Your computer has your private data, first you backup it.

Your computer has to be cleaned for us each other.
I don't need your private data.
It's safe to follow me.

I forgot to say something important. I need to know your account password to use it.

After you are ready, send me your AnyDesk address.

2:46 AM
I'm sending you my email address because I think you might need it.  My email address : anat.fulldev@gmail.com

If my skype is not working, please send email.

If I may say a word for your safety while our credit is not yet established, I promise that you will occasionally observe my work, and if I break my promise to you and misbehave, you may notify me and stop my work.
3:06 AM
If I ever want to do something unrelated to your computer, I will let you know in advance and get your approval.
But that will rarely happen.
Right now, I think what's important for us is to earn each other's trust.
I will work hard to earn money as promised to you, and you will guarantee my working conditions as much as possible as promised to me.
I really want you to be my true business partner for each other.
I sincerely hope that our meeting today will be of great benefit to both of us
